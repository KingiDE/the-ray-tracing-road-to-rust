# The Ray Tracing Road to Rust

This is the repository for the website: The Ray Tracing Road to Rust, a tutorial to help people learn Rust by building a ray tracer and comparing Rust with C++ using tabs interactively.

The tutorial is adapted from the awesome book: [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/v3/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black, and Steve Hollasch.

The website is built with Nextra, Next.js, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Remark, and MDX.
