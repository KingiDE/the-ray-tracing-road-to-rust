# Getting Started

## Development Setup

<Steps>
  ### Rust

  If you haven't installed [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) yet, follow the official [instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install.

  ### Visual Studio Code

  We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the code editor with the following extensions:

  *   [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) for auto-completion, formatting, error reporting, etc.
  *   [CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb) for debugging

  You can see how we configure the editor for Rust [here](https://github.com/chousheng/ray-tracing-starter-rust). And for C++ [here](https://github.com/chousheng/ray-tracing-starter-cpp) if you are interested.

  ### Initializing the Project

  [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html) is Rust's build tool and package manager. To initialize a project, run below in the terminal:

  ```sh
  cargo new ray-tracing
  ```

  It will scaffold the project like this:

  ```
  .
  └── ray-tracing
      ├── Cargo.toml
      └── src
          └── main.rs
  ```

  The `Cargo.toml` file is where we define our dependencies. The `src` folder is where we put our source files. The `main.rs` file is a "hello world" program Cargo generated for us.

  ### Hello World

  Change into the `ray-tracing` directory and run `cargo run`:

  ```sh
  cd ray-tracing
  cargo run
  ```

  Cargo will build and run the project. You'll see the greeting below in the terminal:

  ```
  Hello, world!
  ```

  And you are ready to go!
