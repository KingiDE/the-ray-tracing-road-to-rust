# Introduction

This website is based on the awesome book: [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) (v3.2.3) by Peter Shirley.

In this version, Rust code blocks are added (along with C++ code for comparison). We hope that this interesting project helps people learn the basics of Rust.

Have fun!
