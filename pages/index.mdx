# Introduction

Welcome! This is a tutorial to write a ray tracer in Rust, based on the awesome book: [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley, Trevor David Black, and Steve Hollasch.

The goal of this tutorial is to help you learn Rust by implementing this interesting project. If you have completed some Rust learning resources (e.g., [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/), [Rustlings](https://rustlings.cool/), [Comprehensive Rust](https://google.github.io/comprehensive-rust/), etc.), this is a good project to do.

To help you learn Rust, we adapt the original book and provide a reference implementation in Rust. We use smart pointers throughout the tutorial to avoid explicit lifetime annotations -- you won't learn much about Rust's lifetimes, but this also makes code much nicer to work with.

We modify the original C++ code to be more Rust-ish and let you switch the languages with tabs. If you know a bit about C++, you can compare Rust with C++ interactively. The C++ code is formatted with clang-format and linted with clang-tidy to ensure the code looks consistent and idiomatic. To facilitate comparison, we try to minimize content jumping when you switch languages.

Finally, additional chapters are added in the appendix. You will learn how to parallelize the program with Rayon and make the rust code rustier with Option enum.

Along the way, you'll use the following Rust features:

*   Basic syntax

*   Ownership

*   References and borrowing

*   Move and copy semantics

*   Modules, Cargo, and crates

*   Generics, traits, trait bounds, and supertraits

*   Common traits: Copy, Clone, Default, Write

*   Operator overloading traits: Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Neg, etc.

*   Concurrency Traits: Send and Sync

*   Trait objects

*   The `Box<T>` smart pointer to allocation memory on heap

*   The `RC<T>` smart pointer to share ownership

*   The `Arc<T>` smart pointer to share data between threads

*   The `Option<T>` enum to safely model optional or nullable data

*   Closures

*   And more ...

Have fun!
