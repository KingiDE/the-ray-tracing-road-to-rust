## Getting started

<Steps>

### Rust

If you haven't installed [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) yet, follow the official [instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install.

### Visual Studio Code

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the code editor with the following extensions:

-   [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) (for auto-completion, formatting, linting, etc.)
-   [CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb) (for debugging)

You can see how we configure the editor for Rust here. And for C++ here if you are interested.

### Initializing the project

[Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html) is Rust's build tool and package manager. To initialize a project, run below in the terminal:

```sh
cargo new ray-tracing
```

It will scaffold the project like this:

```
.
└── ray-tracing
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        └── main.rs
```

The `Cargo.toml` file is where we define our dependencies. The `src` folder is where we put our source files. The `main.rs` file is a “hello world” program Cargo generated for us.

### Hello world

Change into the `ray-tracing` directory and run `cargo run`:

```sh
cd ray-tracing
cargo run
```

Cargo will build and run the project. You should see the greeting below in the terminal:

```
Hello, world!
```

And you are ready to go!
